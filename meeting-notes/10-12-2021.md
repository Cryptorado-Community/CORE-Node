## Overview

DAO's core value about trying `connect people to learn and grow personally and professionally.`
From this our mission is to` accelerate individuals and companies to succeed in the blockchain, dweb, and crypto industry`
And the vision is `a thriving community building and leading the charge into the ideal decentralized, dweb technology fueled, society together`

`Important Piece`: This project is very _ambitious!_ This is where the DAO comes in. We create a project with SO much work to do, that there will be constant work for NEW people to come in and do. It may take years, and churn through hundreds of people. But that's okay. It provides tremendous opportunity.

- centered around community and what we can do together
- community naturally has a lot of inflow and outflow (churn)
- Do something more with this community and the cool people that really care
- incubate individuals
  - passionate about web3/blockchain/crypto
- Community working collaboratively together to dive into this metaverse
  - at least core team that wants to work on DAO
  - DAO is for the people that are really passionate and want to work towards it growth
- Professional focus
  - equip with you knowledge to get a job in the industry
- symbiotic with people that are non-technical to make things bigger and better
- **help everybody help each other**
- Incentivize people to do the hard work and launch into the metaverse
- Do NOT become something that owns people
  - no equity
- feedback loop of "alumni"
- as soon as we have something that is tangible showing proof that the DAO is creating hireable people
  - money, lots of it
  - and we do not need to own the people (equity, or anything else)
- accelerate individuals and groups to grow and thrive in the crypto space
- find people that can contribute to the community
- we do not _need_ it to be on-chain
- cohort based self-learning model
- kick it off at anytime
- `social structure and objective to try and get people to grow personally and professionally`
- grand scheme of growing web3.0
- go from nothing to some MVP of something
- DAO is a cohort of purpose-driven people to generate MVP
- Cryptorado always free, but money won't be a problem
- We need DAO to manage this treasury
- invest in people directly

### Accounting and Payment Mechanism

- [sourcecred.io](sourcecred.io) is how the DAO should kind of work
  - an algorithmic view of interactions and how it plays into reputation
- do something similar in cohort models and DAO model
- social reputation, non-financial (or could be), but more about the head-game and earning points for yourself and _tangibly_ impacted x amount of people

## Why Substrate?

Substrate is easily reusable

- anybody else could fork and design whatever they are after (using the created substrate implementation we have for the node)

## UC Berkeley Model

we want to build this kind of model:
constantly running "circuit" (hackathon-ish)
`https://discord.com/channels/757377957110087722/918625717200240662/918900738850164776` <-- UCB goals for semester. Take this idea and make it constantly running for anyone to join at anytime

- Top Tier <-- change the verb here
  - basic blockchain stuff, get you moving to MVP
- Mid Tier <-- more fit for cryptorado
  - jobs are really lucrative
  - help people get into startups and jobs
- Minimal Tier
  - understanding concepts and being ahead of adoption curve
  - worst case, just exposing to web3.0/crypto
  - experiment and play with tech

# Node Goals (Implementation of Above)

https://github.com/Cryptorado-Community/Cryptorado-Node/blob/main/GOALS.md

Community hosted cloud server

- replacement for GSuite
- GitHub
- Any community or group that has some DevOps, or tech people
- Sharded network that is community maintained
- Permissioned and private network (can be open and public)
- [Nextcloud.com](https://nextcloud.com)
  - GSuite replacement, self-hosted
  - Like dropbox
  - Self-hosted
  - OnlyOffice is getting close to replacing google docs
  - OpenSource does not spy on you
  - use frontend of nextcloud
  - replace backend with some IPFS system
  - `TBD:` How connected is Frontend and Backend
- `Infinite Rabbit Hole of Pet Projects! So many things people can come in and do`
- Make this Node the backend of this sharded file-system
  - sharded core to build all of this other stuff on
- Ability to host their own data, and have access to the network to host these services
- Forkable community cloud
- Easy as possible for other people to use. Completely free and open source
- We could turn on some tokenomics and turn it into a service
  - we could easily offer service to set all of this up
- `No Vendor Lock`
- Vendor could be community, or some vendor that happens to use our free software

## Services (GOALS.md, link above)

- IPFS
- [disroot.org](https://disroot.org)
  - A suite of software that are (better) alternatives to the data-selling, non-community driven companies
- Matrix backend tightly coupled to this sharded network
- Search that is community curated. Community-curated search filters
  - AlgoDAO, community filtering of content
  - peer-prediction mechanisms
  - Justin should be on the call
- Do these #group-hacking calls on [veertly.com](https://veertly.com)
- [sunshine-keybase](https://github.com/sunshine-protocol/sunshine-keybase)
  - Implementation of Keybase Protocol on substrate
  - using IPFS, and off-chain workers
- Substrate
  - Enables devs to easily build blockchains
    1. modular, plug-and-play lego blocks
    2. Enable blockchain devs to easily become "parachains" in DOT ecosystems
    3. Upgradeable. Most blockchains are HARD to update, Substrate is easy
  - Has components fully compatible with EVM [Frontier](https://github.com/paritytech/frontier/)

## Game Plan

- [Trappist](https://github.com/TrappistNetwork/trappist)
  - Trappist is a versatile Proof-of-Authority (PoA) Blockchain software that supports hosting decentralized applications (dApps), including Smart Contracts, Crypto-tokens & Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs).
